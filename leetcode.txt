938. Range Sum of BST
Given the root node of a binary search tree, return the sum of values of all nodes with value between L and R (inclusive).
The binary search tree is guaranteed to have unique values.

Example 1:
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], L = 7, R = 15
Output: 32

Example 2:
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], L = 6, R = 10
Output: 23

21. Merge Two Sorted Lists
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Example:
Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4

26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
