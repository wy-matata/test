938. Range Sum of BST
Given the root node of a binary search tree, return the sum of values of all nodes with value between L and R (inclusive).
The binary search tree is guaranteed to have unique values.

Example 1:
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], L = 7, R = 15
Output: 32

Example 2:
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], L = 6, R = 10
Output: 23

21. Merge Two Sorted Lists
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Example:
Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4
